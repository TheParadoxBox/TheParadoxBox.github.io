			Scoring
		</h1>
		<!-- Copied and pasted from my Joplin notebook. Formatting is inconsistent with the rest of the site, but that's okay because this is HTML, not Python. -->
		<p>The scoring for Charged Up is as follows. Numbers are in Match Points, except in the Ranking Points category. Huge thanks to Team 8046: The Lakerbots.</p>
		<h2>Autonomous</h2>
		<p><strong>Robot bumper leaves its Community</strong> - 3<br>
		<strong>Game Piece on low Node</strong> - 3<br>
		<strong>Game Piece on middle Node</strong> - 4<br>
		<strong>Game Piece on high Node</strong> - 6<br>
		<strong>Docked on Charge Station, not engaged</strong> - 8<br>
		<strong>Docked on Charge Station, engaged</strong> - 12</p>
		<p>Note 1: only the points from one robot being docked and/or engaged are counted in Auto. If, for example, two robots are docked and engaged, only 12 points will be awarded.</p>
		<p>Note 2: a robot cannot start on the Charge Station.</p>
		<h2>Teleoperated</h2>
		<p><strong>Game Piece on low Node</strong> - 2<br>
		<strong>Game Piece on middle Node</strong> - 3<br>
		<strong>Game Piece on high Node</strong> - 5<br>
		<strong>Link (three Game Pieces in a row)</strong> - 5</p>
		<p>Note: four Game Pieces in a row is not two Links. If you had all the Game Pieces in one row, you would need six pieces for two Links.</p>
		<h2>Endgame</h2>
		<p><strong>Robot completely inside Community</strong> - 2<br>
		<strong>Docked on Charging Station, not engaged</strong> - 6<br>
		<strong>Docked on Charging Station, engaged</strong> - 10</p>
		<h2>Ranking Points</h2>
		<p><strong>Win</strong> - 2<br>
		<strong>Tie</strong> - 1<br>
		<strong>Lose</strong> - 0<br>
		<strong>Sustainability Bonus (Five Links)</strong> - 1<br>
		<strong>Coopertition Bonus (three Game Pieces in both Co-op Grids)</strong> - Sustainability Bonus requirement is down to four Links<br>
		<strong>Activation Bonus (26 points from Charge Station)</strong> - 1</p>
