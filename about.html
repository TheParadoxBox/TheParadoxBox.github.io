					<h2>
						Why not the Unlicense, WTFPL, etc.?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Short answer: they're public domain dedications, which don't apply everywhere.	
					</p>
					<p>
						Long answer: they're public domain dedications, which have questionable legality internationally. For example, Germany does not have a public domain. Public domain dedication licenses are invalid in countries like Germany, so content that uses them falls back to All Rights Reserved. That's not what I'm aiming for at all, so I chose MIT-0, a license that gives the same permissions as public domain dedication while still retaining copyright.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Why not 0BSD?
					</h2>
					<p>
						(0BSD, or the 0-clause BSD license, is another public-domain-equivalent license.)
					</p>
					<p>
						I just like the wording of MIT-0 better. It's more specific about all of the wonderful things you can do with the software.
